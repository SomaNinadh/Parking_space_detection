# Parking_space_detection

Title : ParkEasy


Description of the hack : 
Our project simplifies parking with real-time updates on space availability. Users scan a QR code upon entry to see open spots instantly. Exiting, they can pay with cash or cashless methods, reducing wait times and congestion.
Features:
>Instant Space Availability: View open spots upon QR scan.
>Convenient Payments: Pay with cash or cashless methods at exit.
Implementation:
>YOLOv8 Algorithm: Powers real-time space detection.
>Live Camera Feeds Integration: Seamless updates from cameras.
>Intuitive User Interface: Simple, visual display of available spaces.
Benefits:
>Efficiency Boost: Streamlines parking, saving time.
>Traffic Reduction: Guides users to open spots, easing congestion.
>No Wait Times: Smooth exits without long lines.
Our goal is to make parking hassle-free, efficient, and user-friendly for everyone.
